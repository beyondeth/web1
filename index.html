  The prosecution has arrested Yoo Dong-gyu, a key figure in the project to develop Daejang-dong in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, on charges of breach of trust and bribery. The court granted prosecutors a warrant on Sunday.

He is the first suspect charged in connection with the land development scandal.

Yoo is accused of causing damage to Seongnam by designing a profit share scheme that favored a certain company and its seven affiliates. Under the scheme, the city received 182.2 billion won ($153 million) in fixed dividends while the civilian investors whose investment totaled 350 million won reaped 404 billion won in variable dividends.

At the time of designing the profit model, Yoo was the chief of the planning headquarters of Seongnam Development Corp. and later was promoted to acting president.
